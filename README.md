A Lattice Boltzmann Solver to simulate compressible fluids

Uses Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook collision operator and includes periodic and solid boundry conditions.

Visualizing the fluid's velocity field by taking the L2 norm of velocity at each point. 
The scene contains a solid cylinder in the center and initial fluid velocities that random, but X is constrained to be positive.

An initial shockwave can be seen propgating through the simulation and wrapping around the periodic boundry condition.

The top and bottom boundry conditions are set as solid objects with 0 velocity and the fluid demonstrates a no-slip conditon
by also having 0 velocity.

Von Karman vortices start to form near the end of the simulation
